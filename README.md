Status
======
This is a relatively stable repository.

Description
===========
This repository contains descriptions of platforms participating
in CK-based crowdsourcing of experiments such as multi-objective
autotuning. Entries are first automatically created at cknowledge.org/repo ,
then moved here, updated manually by the community to add important
features (required to apply CK-based machine learning techniques
and predict optimizations or gradually model behavior of all programs).

Concepts described in the following publications
